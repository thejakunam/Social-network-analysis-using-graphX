Network was collected by crawling Amazon website. It is based on Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought feature of the Amazon website. If a product i is frequently co-purchased with product j, the graph contains a directed edge from i to j.

A list of all vertices has been obtained by combining the distinct node ids from "FromNodeId" and "ToNodeId" columns.
Edges or relationships are established based on data. A Graph is formed using these vertices and edges.

outdegree - in this case, nodes with highest outdegree indicate a variety of products are co-purchased with this specific product

indegree - in this case, node with highest indegree indicate it is the most co-purschased item with other products

pagerank - indicates the combination of products that are most frequently co-purchased

connected components - through this, we can approximate clusters and every component is labelled

triangle count - this indicates a mutual co-purchasing relationship among products.
